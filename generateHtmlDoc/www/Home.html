<p>Welcome to the CatraMMS wiki!</p>
<h2 id="media-management-system">Media Management System</h2>
<p>CatraMMS, Media Management System, is a platform by which it is possible to manage</p>
<ul>
<li>a workflow (i.e.: ingest two videos, concatenate them, cut the resulting video, overlay a logo on it, encode it using different profiles)</li>
<li>custom metadata associated to each content</li>
<li>an array of Encoders, manage the priority of each encoding and manage dedicated Encoder</li>
<li>media functionalities (i.e.: cut, concatenate, overlay, slideShow, ...)</li>
<li>delivery of contents</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>platform is already available in the cloud</strong> and all the URLs, examples and tutorial within the wiki pages refer the MMS cloud.</p>
<p>Media content might be a video, an audio, an image, a playlist.</p>
<p>It is designed to be used as a Service where a User has to register first and then will be able to use all the features of the platform. Once a User is registered, a Workspace is created for him and all the created contents will be associated to the Workspace.</p>
<p>Actually CatraMMS is using FFMpeg to encode the contents. Anyway, CatraMMS is designed to easily be integrated with any other encoding platform.</p>
<p>CatraMMS provides a detailed <strong>REST APIs</strong> from which it is possible to do any kind of activity toward the platform. Even a GUI/APP can be built based on the APIs.</p>
<p>Here follow the Physical Architecture of the CatraMMS:</p>

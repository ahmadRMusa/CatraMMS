<p>Welcome to the CatraMMS wiki!</p>
<h2 id="media-management-system">Media Management System</h2>
<p>CatraMMS, Media Management System, is a platform by which it is possible to ingest, process, Encode.html and deliver media contents.</p>
<p>The platform is already available in the cloud and the API.html are available through the URL <strong><a href="https://mms-API.html.catrasoft.cloud/catramms/v1/" class="uri">https://mms-API.html.catrasoft.cloud/catramms/v1/</a>...</strong> (see details in the appropriate Wiki section).</p>
<p>Media content might be a video, an audio, an image, a playlist.</p>
<p>It is designed to be used as a Service where a User has to register first and then will be able to use all the features of the platform. Once a User is registered, a Workspace is created for him and all the created contents will be associated to the Workspace.</p>
<p>Actually CatraMMS is using FFMpeg to Encode.html the contents. Anyway, CatraMMS is designed to easily be integrated with any other encoding platform.</p>
<p>CatraMMS provides a detailed <strong>REST API.htmls</strong> from which it is possible to do any kind of activity toward the platform. Even a GUI/APP can be built based on the API.htmls.</p>
<p>Here follow the Physical Architecture of the CatraMMS:</p>

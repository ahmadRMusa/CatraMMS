<p>The Catra MMS (Media Management System) API.htmls are <strong>REST Web Services</strong> over Secure HTTP (SSL). The Client API.html is the only way a client application is able to interact with the MMS.</p>
<p>Any API.html, to be called, needs an <strong>API.html Key</strong> as Basic Authentication.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Registration</strong>. First of all a User has to be registered in the CatraMMS platform. Details on the API.html to be called for the registration can be found <a target="main" href="http://mms.catrasoft.cloud/User-registration.html">here</a>. The registration provides the User an API.html Key that has to be used to interact with the platform.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MMS API.html</strong>. Once the User has his API.html Key, he will be able to call any MMS API.htmls. The main way to interact with the CatraMMS platform is doing an Ingestion of metadata to tell the platform what it has to do. For this reason it is defined a <a target="main" href="http://mms.catrasoft.cloud/A.2-Language-used-by-the-ingestion-(Workflow.html-implementation).html">simple language</a> allowing the User to write a Workflow.html of tasks that CatraMMS has to execute.</p></li>
</ol>
